A thin plate   
Temperature at its center is kept at 800 K    
The whole plate surface is initialized at 270 K   
The boundaries are thermally insulated (Neumann).

-------------------------

A thin plate  
No diffusion occurs in the plate only advection  
Advection occurs diagonally  
Bottom-left corner of the plate is kept at 800k  
The whole plate surface is initialized at 270 K  
The boundaries are Dirichlet, contrained at 270K

A conter-flow heat exchanger  
The temperature of  the cold source is 280K  
The temperature of  the hot source is 360K
